 Arduino How To: Use sub folders for source code
	http://www.visualmicro.com/
#####################################################

* .INO code can exist in the project folder and '\src' folder.
* .Cpp/.c/.S/.h etc. can exist in the project folder, the '\src' folder and in any folder(s) below the '\src' folder.
* .Cpp/.c/.S/.h sources in shared code projects should follow the same folder rules (because they are merged with the project sources into a temporary build folder prior to compile).

* Use the 'Show All Files' icon above the 'Solution Explorer' to switch between 'included project files' and 'physical files/folders'.
* Source code in the project folder will always be compiled regardless of inclusion in the project. This functionality can be disabled in Global Options.


To use this project you will need "Wire" and "invensense imu" libraries. Also you need "Arduino AVR boards" since we use the Arduino mega in this project.
You will connect the Primary arduino to the loomo and the secondary to RX1 and TX1 so not to interfere. Connect RX of one to TX on the other.
